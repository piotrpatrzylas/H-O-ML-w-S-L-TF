1. How would you define Machine Learning?
It is teaching computer to learn without explicitly stating all the information/rules about the World.

2. Can you name four types of problems where it shines?
-complicated problems thad would require lots of tuning/instructions
-hard problems where no simple solution(s) exist
-problems for which inputs are changing rapidly, need to adapt/learn quickly
-getting insight from Big Data

3. What is a labeled training set?
This is a set used in supervised ML for training an algorithm. It contains y variable (response).

4. What are the two most common supervised tasks?
Classification and regression.

5. Can you name four common unsupervised tasks?
-clustering
-dimension reduction (PCA)
-visualization (dendrograms)
-anomaly detection

6. What type of ML algorithm would you use to allow a robot to walk in various unknown terrains?
